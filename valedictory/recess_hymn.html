            Ye people of His choice. <br>
            Let all to whom He lendeth breath<br>
            Now in His Name rejoice.<br>
            For love’s blest revelation,<br>

            O praise Him for His holiness, <br>
            His wisdom, and His grace; <br>
            Sing praises for His precious blood <br>
            Which ransomed all our race. <br>
            In tenderness He sought us; <br>
            From depths of sin He brought us; <br>
            The way of life then taught us. <br>
            To Him give thanks.

            Had I a thousand tongues to sing, <br>
            The half could ne’er be told <br>
            Of love so rich, so full and free, <br>
            Of blessings manifold; <br>
            Of grace that faileth never, <br>
            Peace flowing as a river <br>
            From God, the glorious Giver. <br>
            To Him give thanks.
